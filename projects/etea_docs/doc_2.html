        <p>jaja awesome tie stuff here… mwah</p>

        <h3>Blowing Up</h3>
          <p>To keep our community informed, we recently launched <a href="https://x.com/glorboba" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@glorboba" target="_blank">TikTok</a> accounts dedicated to ETea. Our goal is to post regular updates about the game’s development, share behind-the-scenes content, and post engaging content built upon popular trends.</p>
        
        <p>By maintaining an active social media presence, we aim to grow our community. Posting consistently and interacting with our fans humanizes us as game developers. Jamms is built upon the idea of utilizing creativity and a sense of personality for everything we do.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually, we plan to create a Discord server to cultivate a platform where our community feels comfortable conversing about ETea and sharing feedback with us.</p>

        <h3>fun kickstarter header here? kick STAR ter heh. Heh</h3>
        <p>As ETea continues to gain traction, we’ve been thinking about ways to offer fans additional ways to support our team. Since the game itself is free, we want to create tangible rewards that will excite players about what we are working on.</p>
        
        <p>We already have a few rewards in mind, such as collectible charms/stickers and an art book showcasing the characters, sprite work, and art direction of ETea. Taking inspiration from previously successful indie game campaigns, we may offer in-game rewards for certain tiers such as designing an NPC or collectible for our gachapon system.</p>
        
        <p>The reception and feedback gained from the Kickstarter will be instrumental as we start considering potential expansions for ETea… eventually.</p>
        
        <p>We plan to launch our campaign during Steam Next Fest, taking advantage of the event’s excitement to maximize our visibility. Our current priority is to continue developing and polishing a playable demo to showcase at the event. We’re planning for the demo to last from the introduction of the game to the first boss fight, allowing players to test out our prominent game modes while building excitement for the content present in full release.</p>

        <h3>fun press kit header</h3>
        <p>We’re also in the early stages of developing a press kit for ETea. Our press kit will include high-quality promotional material and key information about the game, making it accessible for media platforms to cover ETea and share it with their audiences.</p>
        
        <p>Keep your eyes on the stars and your hands on the tea!! :3</p>
