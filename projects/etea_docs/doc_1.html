        <h3>Section 1</h3>
        <p>This summer, we decided to participate in Interstellar Game Jam 6. Our small team had only attempted one jam before this, but we were excited to have another opportunity to develop a finished project in a structured manner. Despite only having four days, we wanted to create something out of this world – literally!</p>
    
        <p>After the theme was revealed to be <strong>isolation</strong>, we were immediately drawn to the vast uncertainty of space. Eventually, we settled on the concept of an “alien barista.” We wanted to subvert classic “lost in space” science-fiction tropes by portraying a light-hearted scenario where our alien protagonist Glorbo crash-lands on Earth and is mistaken as the newest employee of the hottest boba store in town.</p>
    
        <p>The name ETea was chosen as homage to the classic 1982 film <em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em> in addition to as a reference to the boba tea shop where Glorbo works.</p>
    
        <p>The core gameplay loop was inspired by the Papa’s series, which played a large part in our team’s childhoods. We sought to create a fast-paced environment where the player has to switch between various stations while juggling multiple timed, nuanced orders. Our team designed the difficulty to dynamically scale as the shift progresses.</p>
    
        <p>Another integral mechanic was the stealth system, which we incorporated to subtly reinforce our narrative focus on <strong>isolation</strong>. Players had to ensure Glorbo stayed hidden behind the machinery and out of the customers’ lines of sight! Getting caught or serving the wrong order causes the “sus” bar to gradually increment, ultimately leading to a bad ending when full.</p>
    
        <p>Conversely, serving the right orders allowed Glorbo to start earning money! After making it through a full shift, players are treated to a good ending where Glorbo is revealed as an alien but accepted by everyone.</p>
    
        <p>Despite being under a time constraint, our team proactively sought to make the most of each day. The process was truly interdisciplinary, as members of our team crafted intricate sprite work, backgrounds, and sound design to complement the collaborative C# scripts holding the project together.</p>
    
        <p>We submitted the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/interstellar-game-jam-6/rate/2766589" target="_blank">final jam build</a> with a few hours to spare, having dedicated the past few days to developing and polishing our output. Upon release, the game seemed to immediately resonate with the other members of the jam. We ultimately placed #1 in Art, #3 in Sound, and #4 Overall out of 82 entries.</p>
    
        <p>Participating in the jam allowed us to receive a ton of valuable feedback, particularly a comment from itch.io user <em>niddelicious</em>: “If this was further developed into a larger release I would definitely buy it.” Our priorities were no longer focused on placing well in the jam. Rather, we were proud to have created a concept that people genuinely enjoyed and saw potential in. As a team, we knew we had to take it further.</p>
    
        <p>The game had its quirks, though. Our order queue system needed fixing, and the absence of a pause button and proper settings menu was a glaring oversight that seemed unfeasible to implement amidst the time limit established by the jam.</p>
    
        <p>So, with all of this feedback in mind and our passion for the concept driving us, we decided to expand our ambitions for the game and set our sights on a thorough <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085040/ETea/" target="_blank">Steam release</a>. We have been ironing out bugs and planning the scope of the new features we would like to add.</p>
    
        <p>These include, but are not limited to, a proper narrative, shops to purchase items, boss battles, and numerous opportunities for Glorbo to interact with the supporting cast and his environment.</p>
    
        <p>We are excited to share our iterative progress with you through this documentation!</p>

        <p>She nervously peered over the edge. She understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful, but all she felt was fear. There had always been something about heights that disturbed her, and now she could feel the full force of this unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build. She couldn't help but feel that something horrible was about to happen.</p>
